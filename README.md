# EasyFarm
EasyFarm is a general purpose farming tool for Final Fantasy XI

EasyFarm helps reduce tedious work by automating the farming process. This allows a player to concentrate on important game aspects, instead of boring, non-essential parts. Rather than relying on job specific optimizations, its general design allows for adapting to many situations and enables support all job types.
